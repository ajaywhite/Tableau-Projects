# CO2 Pollution Dashboard

This repository contains a Tableau project analyzing CO2 pollution data. The dashboard provides insights into global CO2 emissions, trends over time, and the impact of various factors on pollution levels.

## Project Overview

The "CO2 Pollution Dashboard" project presents a detailed analysis of CO2 emissions across different regions and over time. The analysis aims to:

- **Visualize Trends**: Show how CO2 emissions have changed over time.
- **Regional Analysis**: Compare emissions between different countries and regions.
- **Impact Analysis**: Understand the factors contributing to CO2 emissions.
- **Forecasting**: Predict future emission trends based on historical data.

## Dashboard Features

The Tableau dashboard included in this project offers several key features:

- **Interactive Filters**: Users can filter data by year, region, and type of emission source.
- **Visual Summaries**: Charts and graphs displaying CO2 emission trends, comparisons, and impacts.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Maps illustrating emissions by country and region.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Trend lines and forecast models predicting future emissions.

## Accessing the Dashboard Online
